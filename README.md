üìñ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict future weekly sales based on historical data. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:

Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Loading and merging multiple data sources (train.csv, stores.csv, features.csv).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover trends, seasonality, and correlations.

Time Series Modeling: Using Meta's Prophet library to build a robust forecasting model that automatically detects yearly and weekly seasonal patterns.

Model Evaluation: Rigorously testing the model's performance using time series cross-validation to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Interactive Visualization: Building a user-friendly web application with Streamlit to visualize the forecast and its underlying components.

Professional Code Structure: The project is refactored into a clean, modular structure, separating data logic, forecasting functions, and the user interface.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Forecasting: Users can select a forecast horizon (in weeks) and instantly generate a prediction.

Detailed Visualizations: The app displays the forecast with uncertainty intervals, allowing users to see the potential range of outcomes.

Model Interpretability: The "Forecast Components" plot breaks down the prediction into its core parts (overall trend, yearly seasonality, and weekly seasonality), making the model's logic easy to understand.

Clean, Modular Code: The application logic is separated into different source files for easier maintenance and scalability.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
